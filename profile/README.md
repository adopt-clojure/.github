Adopt Clojure is just an idea I have for an umbrella project for a bunch of different tools for Clojure.

There's 5 different projects I'm thinking of at the moment, all of which are in very early stages:

### Clj-setup 
A tool to quickly get Clojure and a Clojure IDE set up on a new computer. It installs Clojure itself, a JDK, VSCode, some editor extensions, and a couple helpful CLI tools for Clojure.

Status: in progress

### Learn-clj 
An adaptation of an OCaml textbook for learning Clojure.
Book: https://cs3110.github.io/

Status: in progress

### Learn-clj videos 
A YouTube channel (or other video platform) to provide video-based material for people wanting to learn Clojure.

Status: idea land

### clj-live 
A server-side rendering framework for Clojure utilizing html over the wire to eliminate client-side code and vdom.

Some people think Clojure needs a "killer framework" like RoR to gain big adoption - maybe I could do something about that?

Status: idea land

### Adopt-clojure.org 
A better website for Clojure to encourage people to take the dive into Clojure.

Status: early
